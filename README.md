# Background:
##Pain Point: 
In the healthcare industry, there is a constant challenge of overbookings, causing delay in services offered to the patients. ‘No Shows’ is one of the factors leading to the overbookings.

What is a ‘No Show’? A patient may book for a doctor’s appointment at a health center, but does not show up on the appointment date/time. This is called as ‘No Show’ 
1) When a patient books an appointment, his/her name is added to a scheduling report. The appointment date is called as 'Date of Service' in the scheduling report 
2) Each patient is given an unique Personal Number Or Medical Record ID which is used to identify the patient in the scheduling report.
3) At the end of a week, the clinic staff normally creates a Charge Report which is later used to submit claims with the insurance companies for all the patients that visited for that week. 
----- If a patient scheduled an appointment for a particular week and did show up, then his/her name is included in the Charge report.
------ If a patient does a ‘No Show’, his/her name is not in the charge report for the day the appointment was scheduled (date of service). Though the patient name will be in scheduling report
